Hey there – thanks for visiting my website! My name is Levin Güver and I hold a Bachelor of Law and Master of Law (*summa cum laude*) from the University of Zurich, where I was fortunate enough to graduate as valedictorian. I am jointly appointed as a research assistance at both the [Law Faculty](https://www.ius.uzh.ch/de/staff/professorships/alphabetical/mahlmann/team/Levin-G%C3%BCver.html) and the [Philosophy Department](https://www.philosophie.uzh.ch/de/seminar/people/research/ethics_schaber/guever.html). I am an SNSF funded member of the [*Reading Guilty Minds*](https://www.guiltymindslab.com/) group.

My main interests lie in legal philosophy, where I am most passionate about the philosophical foundations underlying the criminal law. I am also interested in action theory and occasionally dabble in neuroethics. In my free time I enjoy going to the gym, reading, and playing chess. 

Do not hesitate to message me if there are any questions as concerns my research and teaching, or my CV.    :-)
